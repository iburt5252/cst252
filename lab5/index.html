		<h1> Challenges</h1>

		<p1> Lab 5 had us complete a few short tasks and document the process, this lab revolved around our
		introduction to java scripts lecture from earlier in the week and had us create a short program to
		find the age of our cars. We went into chrome and defined some varaibales to be used in a simple equation.
		We took a screenshot, moved the information to a .js file in atom and linked the file by using the script tag.
		Lastyly we structured a quick html site to hold our short summary and.  </p1>

		<h2> Problems</h2>

		<p2> This lab was really straightforward because we ran through this exercise during the lecture. The only thing
		that was upsetting was in the console. If you made an error then you would have to start over.
		We did every task without any isssues really, we attribute this to the lecture being a good guide and
		we used a previous site layout for our html/css to streamline the process. </p2>
