				<h1>Lab 3: File Stuctures</h1>
				<p>The idea of this lab was to futher create a local file structure on my computer, add index.html files,
				and upload to the server. The purpose of building a file structure is to be able to navigate to the cst folder
				to our class and build the labs we all need to do.</p>
				<h2>Challenges</hs>
				<p>I didnt encounter any large problems with creating the file structures becasue they were already done from
				the template that was given to us. Making file structures is not hard at all. They are essential for keeping
				all of your work organized.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Below are the file structures that is going to be used by myself to navigate to different areas for class
				assignments and resources. Here are my file structures.</p>
