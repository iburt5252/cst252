		<h1> Challenges</h1>

		<p1> We were tasked to create a function that asked your name as you opened this page.
			Then we took that string (set of characters aka your name) and changed it to an array by splitting it into characthers, mixing them up by using, joining them back to a string and then we displayed that below in a window.</p1>

	</div>

	<div id="prob">

		<h2> Problems</h2>

		<p2> We ran into a lot of issues writing our functions, this was mostly due to syntax errors, not defining variables or simple programming mistakes. Honestly we really cross referenced w3schools, google, the lecture and the lab assignemnt screenshot itself to make it all work in the end. </p2>

	</div>

	<div id="result">

		<h3> Results </h3>

		<p3> We have a page that when opened you are prompted with a question asking the user's name. Then we took your name as a string, converted it to an array so it can be sorted and rejoined to then be displayed in its own div.  </p3>
